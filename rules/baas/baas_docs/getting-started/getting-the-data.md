# Getting the Data

Learn how to receive meeting data through webhooks

# [Getting Meeting Data](#getting-meeting-data)

Your webhook URL will receive two types of data:

1.  Live meeting events during the meeting
2.  Final meeting data after completion

These events will start flowing in after [sending a bot to a meeting](/docs/api/getting-started/sending-a-bot).

## [1\. Live Meeting Events](#1-live-meeting-events)

```
POST /your-endpoint
x-meeting-baas-api-key: YOUR-API-KEY
 
{
  "event": "bot.status_change",
  "data": {
    "bot_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "status": {
      "code": "joining_call",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### [Status Event Fields](#status-event-fields)

-   `event`: The key-value pair for bot status events. Always `bot.status_change`.
-   `data.bot_id`: The identifier of the bot.
-   `data.status.code`: The code of the event. One of:
    -   `joining_call`: The bot has acknowledged the request to join the call.
    -   `in_waiting_room`: The bot is in the "waiting room" of the meeting.
    -   `in_call_not_recording`: The bot has joined the meeting, however it is not recording yet.
    -   `in_call_recording`: The bot is in the meeting and recording the audio and video.
    -   `recording_paused`: The recording has been temporarily paused.
    -   `recording_resumed`: The recording has resumed after being paused.
    -   `call_ended`: The bot has left the call.
    -   `bot_rejected`: The bot was rejected from joining the meeting.
    -   `bot_removed`: The bot was removed from the meeting.
    -   `waiting_room_timeout`: The bot timed out while waiting to be admitted.
    -   `invalid_meeting_url`: The provided meeting URL was invalid.
    -   `meeting_error`: An unexpected error occurred during the meeting.
-   `data.status.created_at`: An ISO string of the datetime of the event.

When receiving an `in_call_recording` event, additional data is provided:

-   `data.status.start_time`: The timestamp when the recording started.

For `meeting_error` events, additional error details are provided:

-   `data.status.error_message`: A description of the error that occurred.
-   `data.status.error_type`: The type of error encountered.
