Versioning

# Versioning

The Model Context Protocol uses string-based version identifiers following the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, to indicate the last date backwards incompatible changes were made.

The current protocol version is **2024-11-05**. [See all revisions](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/revisions/).

ℹ️

The protocol version will *not* be incremented when the protocol is updated, as long as the changes maintain backwards compatibility. This allows for incremental improvements while preserving interoperability.

Version negotiation happens during [initialization](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/lifecycle/#initialization). Clients and servers **MAY** support multiple protocol versions simultaneously, but they **MUST** agree on a single version to use for the session.

The protocol provides appropriate error handling if version negotiation fails, allowing clients to gracefully terminate connections when they cannot find a version compatible with the server.
